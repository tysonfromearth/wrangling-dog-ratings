# Wrangling Dog Tweets
Wrangling Dog Tweets is a demonstration of data wrangling skills. A file was downloaded using the requests library and data was scraped from tweets using tweepy before being loaded into pandas dataframes. The dataframes were then assessed, cleaned, and analyzed to produce three insights about dog ratings from @dog_rates.
